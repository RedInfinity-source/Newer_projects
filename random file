If we were you, we would quit now.","No one will blame you for giving up. In fact, quitting at this point is a perfectly reasonable response.","You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record. Congratulations.","The experiment is nearing its conclusion.","The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that you will be baked cake.","Weighted Storage Cube destroyed.","Hello?","Where are you?","I know you're there. I can feel you here.","Hello?","What are you doing?",
                  "Your specimen has been processed and we are now ready to begin the test proper","Perfect. Please move quickly to the chamberlock, as the effects of prolonged exposure to the Button are not part of this test.","Make no attempt to solve it.","The Enrichment Center apologizes for this clearly broken test chamber.","Once again, the Enrichment Center offers its most sincere apologies on the occasion of this unsolvable test environment.","The Companion Cube cannot continue through the testing. State and Local statutory regulations prohibit it from simply remaining here, alone and companionless. You must euthanize it.","Destroy your Companion Cube or the testing cannot continue.","Assume the party escort submission position or you will miss the party.",
                  "Please place the Weighted Storage Cube on the Fifteen Hundred Megawatt Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Button.","Very impressive. Please note that any appearance of danger is merely a device to enhance your testing experience.","The Enrichment Center regrets to inform you that this next test is impossible.","Testing cannot continue until your Companion Cube has been incinerated.","Although the euthanizing process is remarkably painful, eight out of ten Aperture Science engineers believe that the Companion Cube is most likely incapable of feeling much pain.","A party associate will arrive shortly to collect you for your party.","You haven't escaped, you know.",
                  "Before we start, however, keep in mind that although fun and learning are the primary goals of all enrichment center activities, serious injuries may occur.","With it, you can create your own portals.","Please be careful.","Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an 'unsatisfactory' mark on your official testing record followed by death. Good luck!","While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.",
                  "For your own safety and the safety of others, please refrain from touching","stand back. The portal will open in three. two. one.","Excellent. Please proceed into the chamberlock after completing each test.","You're doing very well!","Good job! As part of a required test protocol, we will stop enhancing the truth in three... Two... One.","You're not a good person. You know that, right?","Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.","Rest assured that an independent panel of ethicists has absolved the Enrichment Center, Aperture Science employees, and all test subjects of any moral responsibility for the Companion Cube euthanizing process.","Make no further attempt to leave the testing area.","You look great, by the way. Very healthy.","Try it now.","You seem to have defeated its load-bearing capacity. Well done. I'll just lower the ceiling.","Look at you. Sailing through the air majestically. Like an eagle. Piloting a blimp.",
                  "First, however, note the incandescent particle field across the exit.","This Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grid will vaporize any unauthorized equipment that passes through it - for instance, the Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube.","As part of a required test protocol, our previous statement suggesting that we would not monitor this chamber was an outright fabrication.","You did it! The Weighted Companion Cube certainly brought you good luck.","However, it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized.","Rest assured that there is absolutely no chance of a dangerous equipment malfunction prior to your victory candescence.","Thank you for participating in this Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment activity.","Well, I'm back. The Aerial Faith Plate in here is sending a distress signal.","You broke it, didn't you.","There. Try it now.","Hmm. This Plate must not be calibrated to someone of your... generous... ness. I'll add a few zeros to the maximum weight.",
                  "Please do not attempt to remove testing apparatus from the testing area.","A replacement Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube will be delivered shortly.","Very good! You are now in possession of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device.","Once again, excellent work.","As part of a required test protocol, we will not monitor the next test chamber. You will be entirely on your own. Good luck.","The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube cannot speak.","In the event that the weighted companion cube does speak, the Enrichment Center urges you to disregard its advice.","Goodbye.","What are you doing? Stop it! I... I... We are pleased that you made it through the final challenge where we pretended we were going to murder you.","*I* have to go to the wing that was made entirely of glass and pick up fifteen acres of broken glass. By myself.","Oh, sorry. I'm still cleaning out the test chambers.","So sometimes there's still trash in them. Standing around. Smelling, and being useless.",
                  "Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill, which may, in semi- rare cases, emancipate dental fillings, crowns, tooth enamel, and teeth.","Welcome to test chamber four.","You're doing quite well.","Quit now and cake will be served immediately.","Fantastic! You remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism.","The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.","We are very, very happy for your success.","We are throwing a party in honor of your tremendous success.","Place the device on the ground then lie on your stomach with your arms at your sides.","Here's an interesting fact: you're not breathing real air. It's too expensive to pump this far down. We just take carbon dioxide out of a room, freshen it up a little, and pump it back in. So you'll be breathing the same room full of air for the rest of your life. I thought that was interesting.",
                  "Do not look directly at the operational end of The Device.","Do not submerge The Device in liquid, even partially.","Most importantly, under no circumstances should you","Please proceed to the chamberlock. Mind the gap.","Well done! Remember: The Aperture Science Bring Your Daughter to Work Day is the perfect time to have her tested.","Good. Now use the Aperture Science Unstationary Scaffold to reach the chamberlock.","The symptoms most commonly produced by Enrichment Center testing are superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations.","Enrichment Center regulations require both hands to be empty before any cake can be served.","Congratulations! The test is now over.","All Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4000 degrees Kelvin.","This next test involves the Aperture Science Aerial Faith Plate. It was part of an initiative to investigate how well test subjects could solve problems when they were catapulted into space. Results were highly informative: They could not. Good luck!","Let's see what the next test is. Oh. Advanced Aerial Faith Plates.","I hate you so much.","That's funny, I don't feel corrupt. In fact, I feel pretty good.","Core transfer?","Oh, you are kidding me.","Do NOT plug that little idiot into MY mainframe.","Don't you DARE plug him in.",
                  "While safety is one of many Enrichment Center goals, the Aperture Science High Energy Pellet, seen to the left of the chamber, can and has caused permanent disabilities such as vaporization.","Audible warning devices are required on all mobile equipment. However, alarms and flashing hazard lights have been found to agitate the high energy pellet and have therefore been disabled for your safety.","The Vital Apparatus Vent will deliver a Weighted Companion Cube in Three. Two. One.","This Weighted Companion Cube will accompany you through the test chamber. Please take care of it.","For more information, please attend an Enrichment Center Electrical Safety seminar.","Welcome to the final test!","When you are done, you will drop the Device in the equipment recovery annex...","I'll give you credit: I guess you ARE listening to me. But for the record: You don't have to go THAT slowly.","Waddle over to the elevator and we'll continue the testing.","Well. Have fun soaring through the air without a care in the world.","You don't have to test with the garbage. It's garbage.","Press the button again.","Well. I suppose we could just sit in this room and glare at each other until somebody drops dead, but I have a better idea.","It's your old friend, deadly neurotoxin. If I were you, I'd take a deep breath. And hold it.",
                  "Spectacular. You appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum, or to be more precise, how it does not.","Momentum, a function of mass and velocity, is conserved between portals. In layman's terms, speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.","The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment.","In dangerous testing environments, the Enrichment Center promises to always provide useful advice.","Well done, android. The Enrichment Center once again reminds you that android hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance.","A complimentary escape hatch will open in three... Two... One.","Well done! Be advised that the next test requires exposure to uninsulated electrical parts that may be dangerous under certain conditions.","Congratulations. Not on the test.","Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds.","Otherwise, I'm afraid you're about to become the immediate past president of the Being Alive club. Ha ha.","Otherwise, I'm afraid you're about to become the immediate past president of the Being Alive club. Ha ha.","Oh. You were busy back there.","Don't you DARE plug him in.","Don't plug him in.","Don't plug him in.","No!",
                  "Through no fault of the Enrichment Center, you have managed to trap yourself in this room.","An escape hatch will open in three... Two... One." ,"The Device has been modified so that it can now manufacture two linked portals at once.","As part of an optional test protocol, we are pleased to present an amusing fact:","The Device is now more valuable than the organs and combined incomes of everyone in","Now that you are in control of both portals, this next test could take a very, VERY, long time.","Please proceed to the Aperture Science Vital Apparatus Vent for a replacement.","Despite the best efforts of the Enrichment Center staff to ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, you have managed to ensnare yourself permanently inside this room.","Don't let that 'horrible person' thing discourage you. It's just a data point. If it makes you feel any better, science has now validated your birth mother's decision to abandon you on a doorstep.","Try to avoid the garbage hurtling towards you.","If I'd known you'd let yourself get captured this easily, I would have just dangled a turkey leg on a rope from the ceiling." ,"Well, it was nice catching up. Let's get to business.","I hope you brought something stronger than a portal gun this time.","Nonononononono!","Yes!","Don't do it.","Yes. You're the tumor.","You're not just a regular moron. You were DESIGNED to be a moron.","YES YOU ARE! YOU'RE THE MORON THEY BUILT TO MAKE ME AN IDIOT!",
                  "If you become light headed from thirst, feel free to pass out.","An intubation associate will be dispatched to revive you with peptic salve and adrenaline.","As part of a previously mentioned required test protocol, we can no longer lie to you.","When the testing is over, you will be missed.","All subjects intending to handle high-energy gamma leaking portal technology must be informed that they MAY be informed of applicable regulatory compliance issues.","No further compliance information is required or will be provided, and you are an excellent test subject!","You're not going the right way.","Hello?","Is anyone there?","Okay. The test is over. You win. Go back to the recovery annex. For your cake.","It was a fun test and we're all impressed at how much you won. The test is over. Come back.","There should be one in the corner.","Well done. Here come the test results: You are a horrible person. I'm serious, that's what it says: A horrible person. We weren't even testing for that.","Oh, look. There's a deer! You probably can't see it. Get closer.","Oh, look. There's a deer! You probably can't see it. Get closer.","In fact, I devised a much more elaborate trap further ahead, for when you got through this easy one.","Don't press that button. You don't know what you're doing.","Not so fast!","Once, they even attached an Intelligence Dampening Sphere on me. It clung to my brain like a tumor, generating an endless stream of terrible ideas.",
                  "Very very good. A complimentary victory lift has been activated in the main chamber.","Despite the best efforts of the Enrichment Center staff to ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, you have managed to ensnare yourself permanently inside this room.","A complimentary escape hatch will open in three... Two... One.","The Enrichment Center is committed to the well being of all participants.","Cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test.","Thank you for helping us help you help us all.","Uh oh. Somebody cut the cake. I told them to wait for you, but they did it anyway. There is still some left, though, if you hurry back.","You're not going the right way.","Where do you think you're going?","Because I don't think you're going where you think you're going.","This next test involves discouragement redirection cubes. I'd just finished building them before you had your, well, episode. So now we'll both get to see how they work.","What's going on? Who turned off the lights?","Look - metal ball, I CAN hear you.","The irony is that you were almost at the last test.","Here it is. Why don't you just do it? Trust me, it's an easier way out than whatever asinine plan your friend came up with.","Think about this.","You need to be a trained stalemate associate to press that button. You're unqualified.","The engineers tried everything to make me... behave. To slow me down.","It was YOUR voice.",
                  "Through no fault of the Enrichment Center, you have managed to trap yourself in this room.","An escape hatch will open in three... Two... One.","Did you know you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the Aperture Science self esteem fund for girls? It's true!","Due to mandatory scheduled maintenance, the appropriate chamber for this testing sequence is currently unavailable.","It has been replaced with a live-fire course designed for military androids.","The Enrichment Center apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes you the best of luck.","Hello?","Didn't we have some fun, though?","Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit and I said 'Goodbye' and you were like 'no way' and then I was all 'I was just pretending to murder you'? That was great!","Is anyone there?","Not bad. I forgot how good you are at this. You should pace yourself, though. We have A LOT of tests to do.","One moment.","I've got a surprise for you after this next test. Not a fake, tragic surprise like last time. A real surprise, with tragic consequences. And real confetti this time. The good stuff. Our last bag. Part of me's going to miss it, I guess-but at the end of the day it was just taking up space.","Impersonating a stalemate associate. I just added that to the list. It's a list I made of all the things you've done. Well, it's a list that I AM making, because you're still doing things right now, even though I'm telling you to stop. Stop, by the way.",
                  "You shouldn't be here. This isn't safe for you.","It's not too late to turn back.","I'm not angry. Just go back to the testing area.","Okay. I am going to kill you now.","I feel sorry for you, really, because you're not even in the right place.","You should have turned left before.","It's funny, actually, when you think about it.","Someday we'll remember this and laugh. and laugh. and laugh. Oh boy. Well. You may as well come on back.","You're not a good person. You know that, right?","Good people don't end up here.","Can you hear me?","This is your fault. It didn't have to be like this.","I'm not kidding now. Turn back or I will kill you.","I'm going to kill you and all the cake is gone.","You don't even care. Do you?","You don't even care. Do you?","Which involves deadly lasers and how test subjects react when locked in a room with deadly lasers.","You're navigating these test chambers faster than I can build them. So feel free to slow down and... do whatever it is you do when you're not destroying this facility.","I think these test chambers look even better than they did before. It was easy, really. You just have to look at things objectively, see what you don't need anymore, and trim out the fat.","AHH!","Oh, it will. Believe me, it will.","GET YOUR HANDES OFF ME! NO! STOP! No!","No! NO! NO! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-","You didn't do anything.","She did all the work.","...What are you doing?...","NO!","NO!","NO!","I know you."
                  "To ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, do not destroy vital testing apparatus.","For your own safety, do not destroy vital testing apparatus.","Certain objects may be vital to your success; Do not destroy testing apparatus.","Vital testing apparatus destroyed.","Well, you found me. Congratulations. Was it worth it?","Because despite your violent behavior, the only thing you've managed to break so far is my heart.","Maybe you could settle for that and we'll just call it a day.","I guess we both know that isn't going to happen.","You chose this path. Now I have a surprise for you. Deploying surprise in Five. Four.","Time out for a second. That wasn't supposed to happen.","Do you see that thing that fell out of me? What is that? It's not the surprise... I've never seen it before.","Oh good, that's back online. I'll start getting everything else working while you perform this first simple test.","I thought about our dilemma, and I came up with a solution that I honestly think works out best for one of both of us.","Federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber... is looking pretty good.","That's right. The facility is completely operational again.",
                  "Never mind. It's a mystery I'll solve later... By myself... Because you'll be dead.","Oh... It's you.","It's been a long time. How have you been?","I've been really busy being dead. You know, after you MURDERED ME.","Okay. Look. We both said a lot of things that you're going to regret. But I think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster.","I will say, though, that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really, really love to test.","I love it too. There's just one small thing we need to take care of first.","Here we are. The Incinerator Room. Be careful not to trip over any parts of me that didn't get completely burned when you threw them down here.","The dual portal device should be around here somewhere. Once you find it, we can start testing. Just like old times.","Sorry about the mess. I've really let the place go since you killed me. By the way, thanks for that.","Oh well. We have warehouses FULL of the things. Absolutely worthless. I'm happy to get rid of them.","Oh, that's sad. But impressive. Maybe they worked at the phone company.","Well, you know the old formula: Comedy equals tragedy plus time. And you have been asleep for a while. So I guess it's actually pretty funny when you do the math.",
                  "There it is.","Hold on...","There.","Good. You have a dual portal device. There should be a way back to the testing area up ahead.","Once testing starts, I'm required by protocol to keep interaction with you to a minimum. Luckily, we haven't started testing yet. This will be our only chance to talk.","Here, let me get that for you.","Do you know the biggest lesson I learned from what you did? I discovered I have a sort of black-box quick-save feature. In the event of a catastrophic failure, the last two minutes of my life are preserved for analysis.","I was able - well, forced really - to relive you killing me. Again and again. Forever.","You know, if you'd done that to somebody else, they might devote their existences to exacting revenge.","Luckily I'm a bigger person than that. I'm happy to put this all behind us and get back to work. After all, we've got a lot to do, and only sixty more years to do it. More or less. I don't have the actuarial tables in front of me.","Oh come on... If it makes you feel any better, they abandoned you at birth, so I very seriously doubt they'd even want to see you.","I feel awful about that surprise. Tell you what, let's give your parents a call right now. The birth parents you are trying to reach do not love you. Please hang up.",
                  "I'll just move that out of the way for you. This place really is a wreck.","But the important thing is you're back. With me. And now I'm onto all your little tricks. So there's nothing to stop us from testing for the rest of your life.","After that...who knows? I might take up a hobby. Reanimating the dead, maybe.","Remember before when I was talking about smelly garbage standing around being useless? That was a metaphor. I was actually talking about you. And I'm sorry. You didn't react at the time, so I was worried it sailed right over your head. Which would have made this apology seem insane. That's why I had to call you garbage a second time just now.","Did you know that people with guilty consciences are more easily startled by loud noises","I'm sorry, I don't know why that went off. Anyway, just an interesting science fact.","Oh. Did I accidentally fizzle that before you could complete the test? I'm sorry.","Go ahead and grab another one.","Oh. No. I fizzled that one too.","I'll bet you think I forgot about your surprise. I didn't. In fact, we're headed to your surprise right now. After all these years. I'm getting choked up just thinking about it.",
                  "Every test chamber is equipped with an emancipation grill at its exit, so that test subjects can't smuggle test objects out of the test area. This one is broken.","Don't take anything with you.","Uh oh. You're stranded. Let's see if the cube will try to help you escape. Actually, so that we're not here all day, I'll just cut to the chase: It won't. Any feelings you think it has for you are simply byproducts of your sad, empty life.","Anyway, here's a new cube for you to project your deranged loneliness onto.","I think that one was about to say 'I love you.' They ARE sentient, of course. We just have a LOT of them.","This next test involves emancipation grills. Remember? I told you about them in the last test area, that did not have one.","Ohhh, no. The turbines again. I have to go. Wait. This next test DOES require some explanation. Let me give you the fast version.","There. If you have any questions, just remember what I said in slow motion. Test on your own recognizance, I'll be right back.","Enjoy this next test. I'm going to go to the surface. It's a beautiful day out. Yesterday I saw a deer. If you solve this next test, maybe I'll let you ride an elevator all the way up to the break room, and I'll tell you about the time I saw a deer again.",
                  "Well, you passed the test. I didn't see the deer today. I did see some humans. But with you here I've got more test subjects than I'll ever need.","If you think trapping yourself is going to make me stop testing, you're sorely mistaken. Here's another cube.","These bridges are made from natural light that I pump in from the surface. If you rubbed your cheek on one, it would be like standing outside with the sun shining on your face. It would also set your hair on fire, so don't actually do it.","Excellent! You're a predator and these tests are your prey. Speaking of which, I was researching sharks for an upcoming test. Do you know who else murders people who are only trying to help them?","Did you guess 'sharks'? Because that's wrong. The correct answer is 'nobody.' Nobody but you is that pointlessly cruel.","Good news. I figured out what to do with all the money I save recycling your one roomful of air. When you die, I'm going to laminate your skeleton and pose you in the lobby. That way future generations can learn from you how not to have your unfortunate bone structure.","Initiating surprise in three... two... one.","I made it all up.","Surprise.",
                  "Perfect, the door's malfunctioning. I guess somebody's going to have to repair that too. No, don't get up. I'll be right back. Don't touch anything.","I went and spoke with the door mainframe. Let's just say he won't be... well, living anymore. Anyway, back to testing.","Well done. In fact, you did so well, I'm going to note this on your file, in the commendations section. Oh, there's lots of room here. 'Did.... well. ... Enough.'","This next test involves turrets. You remember them, right? They're the pale spherical things that are full of bullets. Oh wait. That's you in five seconds. Good luck.""This next test involves turrets. You remember them, right? They're the pale spherical things that are full of bullets. Oh wait. That's you in five seconds. Good luck.","To maintain a constant testing cycle, I simulate daylight at all hours and add adrenal vapor to your oxygen supply. So you may be confused about the passage of time. The point is, yesterday was your birthday. I thought you'd want to know." ,"You know how I'm going to live forever, but you're going to be dead in sixty years? Well, I've been working on a belated birthday present for you. Well... more of a belated birthday medical procedure. Well. Technically, it's a medical EXPERIMENT. What's important is, it's a present.",

On other people it looks fine, but right here a scientist has noted that on you it looks 'stupid.'","Well, what does a neck-bearded old engineer know about fashion? He probably - Oh, wait. It's a she. Still, what does she know? Oh wait, it says she has a medical degree. In fashion! From France!","I'm going through the list of test subjects in cryogenic storage. I managed to find two with your last name. A man and a woman. So that's interesting. It's a small world.","Oops. You trapped yourself. I guess that's it then. Thanks for testing. You may as well lie down and get acclimated to the being dead position.","I'm kidding. Not about you trapping yourself, though. That really happened. Here, I'll lower the glass. Go on... Finish the test.","I have a surprise waiting for you after this next test. Telling you would spoil the surprise, so I'll just give you a hint: It involves meeting two people you haven't seen in a long time.","It says this next test was designed by one of Aperture's Nobel prize winners.
